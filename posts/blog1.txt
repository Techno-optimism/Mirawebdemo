<h2>The Christmas lore</h2>
literally Santa is Marx and the gifts are the dialectical
materialism- in the act of giving a gift your showing of your  true value, it leads to 
class consciousness, it’s quite annoying, before Santa came He didn’t Think about it 
-after Santa visited he was full of prospects and suspicion…. He goes material, forgets all 
about the love of god and that everybody is equal. He suffers from Marxism he got to be 
the dark knight of the soul and this eventually lead him to ascension. 
The immense suffering by being able to see, by being able to watch the goods, see the numbers, 
understand the game, he begin to cast himself into shadows, the path that leads to enlightenment. 
Suffering has always been the keyword , 
<br><br>
So in one act Santa kill god -!: he kill the faith and thereby god become non existent .
In second act he becomes one with the world and work for spreading consciousness 
towards a future with a collective consciousness…. Merry X-MarX
